			<p>
				3 Idiots is a Bollywood production that flashes back and forth between present day, and the characters'
				time in college.
				It starts off with old friends, Qureshi and Raju Rastogi learning that their college pal, Rancho, had
				finally been found.
				The movie follows their travels to find their long lost friend, while flashing back to the events of
				their school years,
				where they often got into amusing shenanigans involving the Dean of Delhi's Imperial College of
				Engineering, Viru Sahastrabudhe,
				and dealt with some serious events that many people encounter in every day life.

				<p>Aamir Khan as Ranchhoddas "Rancho" Shyamaldas Chanchad .Rancho, or Ranchoddas Shamaldas Chanchad, was
					an eternally optimistic genius in the film.

					"The character of Rancho (Ranchoddas Shamaldas Chanchad) in the movie is (based on) me. It is
					inspired from my life," Chopra said while interacting with the delegates in the NFDC's Film Bazaar,
					where he shared interesting anecdotes of his life.

					Chopra is a product of Pune-based Film and Television Institute of India. "I never attended classes
					in the film institute. I failed in the final examination. So, when I was nominated for Oscars, the
					institute called me as a guest and gave me my passing certificate as an honour," said the
					62-year-old filmmaker, who also produced the Munnabhai series.

					According to Chopra, his family wanted him to become a doctor, but he pursued his dream of
					filmmaking.
